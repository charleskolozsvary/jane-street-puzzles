# Background
[Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com) is a quantitative trading firm which posts a "puzzle" every month. But they aren't typical puzzles (like jig-saws or crosswords), they are usually, rather, math-heavy brain teasers. Every now and then I tackle one, and this repository contains my work on them. 

If you haven't already, I suggest you try to solve the [current puzzle](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/) (or, if it doesn't suit your fancy, any of the others in the [archive](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/)---I find, clearly, that they're a lot of fun).

I've also been trying to write in-depth solutions to a number of brain teasers I've found interesting (including Jane Street Puzzles), but progress has been slow. Writing is hard. That collection of solutions lives at https://github.com/charleskolozsvary/brain-teaser-explanations.
