# Altered States 2 (June 2024)
Puzzle: https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/altered-states-2-index/

If I remember correctly, I first found a starting grid by hand and then wrote the python script to test out different grids and check my work.

This was sort of an unsatisfying puzzle because I can't give a systematic explanation for how I arrived at passing grid. I just fiddled around for a while.
